## Getting Started

Start by downloading the resources and setting up your computer using the [Quanser Academic Resources](https://github.com/quanser/Quanser_Academic_Resources) repository.
Make sure to follow the instructions in the `Setting Up Your Computer` Section in that repo.

> [!NOTE]
> **DO NOT FOLLOW ANY OF THE INSTRUCTIONS OF DOWNLOADING QUANSER INTERACTIVE LABS, FOLLOW THE INSTRUCTIONS IN THIS README INSTEAD**  
> The section [How to Download Quanser Interactive Labs](#qlabs) has the specific instructions for this.

You should now have a `C:/Users/user/Documents/Quanser` folder with all of our resources.

## Downloading Arlington Specific Resources

The first step is to download these resources into your computer. We recommend downloading the files simply as a .zip file. 

### How to Download the Resources

1. Inside your `C:/Users/user/Documents/Quanser` folder that was created when downloading the Academic Resources, create a new folder with whatever name you prefer. We suggest calling it something like `Arlington_Competition`. This should live in the same level as the numbered folders (0_libraries, 1_setup ...).
1. Click the green Code button at the top of this GitHub page, click _Download ZIP_ at the bottom of the menu that pops up.
3. Unzip/extract the folder in your system.
4. Go into _Quanser_UT_Arlington_Comp-main_, you will see the individual files. Copy all the contents of that folder into your newly created `C:/Users/user/Documents/Quanser/Arlington_Competition` folder.
